<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>One of the best animes of all time no doubt.The way the story is proclaimed and how it makes your go through a journey is really great.</p>
<h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
<p>The level of acting done by every individual was brilliant and something that made the show even more watchable.</p>
<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<p>Best Movie Ever! I have never enjoyed a movie more than this one... Although the same song plays throughout the movie, it doesn't get old.</p>
